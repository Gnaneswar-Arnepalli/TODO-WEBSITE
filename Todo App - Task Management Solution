This project is a task management app built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. It allows users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) tasks, while maintaining a sleek and user-friendly interface. Tasks are stored in the browserâ€™s localStorage, ensuring that they persist even after the page is refreshed.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add tasks by typing into an input field and clicking the "Add" button.
View Tasks: All tasks are displayed in a list, making it easy for users to manage them.
Mark Tasks as Completed: Users can check/uncheck tasks as completed, with completed tasks being marked with a strikethrough.
Delete Tasks: Users can delete tasks using the delete button next to each task.
Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that they are not lost after refreshing the page or closing the browser.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the application.
CSS/Bootstrap: For styling and responsive design.
JavaScript: For dynamic behavior and CRUD operations.
LocalStorage: To persist tasks in the browser even after the session ends.
